"""Extra positive training samples via Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.

Piper's LibriTTS-R generator provides sample volume (hundreds of speakers,
cheap, local); Google's Neural2/Studio/Chirp voices add a different — and
much higher-fidelity — acoustic character. A modest layer of Google samples
(a few thousand) on top of the Piper set adds voice diversity the model
can't get from a single TTS family.

Clips are written straight into the wake word's positive_train/positive_test
directories. openWakeWord's generate step counts existing files toward
n_samples, so Google clips added *before* `forge.py build` simply displace
that many Piper generations rather than growing the set.

Auth: set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to a service-account JSON with the
Cloud Text-to-Speech API enabled (compose maps /data/google-credentials.json).
